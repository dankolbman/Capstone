\begin{abstract} \noindent Mechanobiology of cell co-cultures, i.e. a binary system of cell populations, is of great interest in the biophysics of embryogenesis and tumor progression. 
During these processes, different types of cells with different physical properties are mixed with each other, with important consequences for cell-cell interaction, aggregation and migration. 
For example, the mechanics and motility of cancer cells in populations of healthy cells has been observed to be dependent on the relative stiffness of the cells. 
Until recently, experiments and theoretical models of cell co-cultures have focused on two dimensional systems.
In physiological conditions, in addition to regions of very small curvature which can be effectively assumed to be $2D$, very often cells have to navigate three dimensional micro environments.
Given that recent experiments point to very different cell migration modes in $3D$ compared to $2D$ in mono-cultures, one can ask how is cell aggregation and migration for co-culture systems different in $3D$.
To answer this question, we will model cell co-culture systems in $3D$ by extending previous $2D$ Brownian Dynamics simulation of a binary system of interacting, active and deformable particles.
Our results will be compared with ongoing experiments in the laboratory of Drs. M. Ma and M. Wu at Cornell.
These experiments are studying 3D co-cultures in confinement and in the presence of an extra cellular matrix.
Accordingly, we will study a $3D$ confined system in an underlying matrix potential.
Our results will provide insights into the role of the difference in physical properties of the two types of cells, such as stiffness and adhesion,
on emergent collective properties such as cell aggregation and migration.

\section*{Background and Motivation}

Recent research provides compelling evidence for clear connections between cell mechanics and collective behavior, and the onset and progression
of several diseases including cancer. Cancer cells are cells that have undergone pathological changes, as a result of which they can divide uncontrollably, 
invade local tissue and metastasize, i.e. spread to distant parts of the body \cite{Suresh}. Metastasis is known to be the leading cause of death in cancer patients but 
its underlying physical mechanism is poorly understood. Experimental research suggests that cells  undergo dramatic changes in their physical properties such 
as cell-cell adhesion, adhesion of cells to the extra-cellular matrix, and cell stiffness during tumor progression \cite{Suresh}.
These changes may play a critical role in the enhanced aggregation and migration of cells with higher metastatic potential.
For example, for breast cancer cells the Young's modulus of the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton and the cell nucleus has 
been measured to be much smaller than that of non-cancerous breast cells \cite{Lee}.
This property has been found to affect the migration of cancer cells in the vicinity of healthy cells\cite{Lee}. 

A simple model of two dimensional homogeneous monolayers of cells  consists of interacting colloidal particles that are also each active, i.e. self-driven \cite{FilyMarchetti,RednerBaskaran}. 
Such models have been previously used to study swarming  behavior \cite{Vicsek} in birds, inspections and fish.
Our group has recently combined this approach with cell mechanics and applied it to a binary population of cells, to study the collective mechanics and dynamics in cell co-cultures characterized by a difference in cell stiffness.
Co-cultures are a valuable system to study early cancer progression, because during this process two cell populations, namely healthy cells and cells that have become cancerous may be intermixed.   
This study found that mechanical mismatch in co-cultures can have important consequences cell migration, and can lead to enhanced motility for more deformable cells\cite{Butcher}, in agreement with
the Lee and coworkers \cite{Lee}. 

Until recently, most experiments and models of cell co-cultures have focused on two dimensional systems, with limited application to physiological conditions\cite{Jong}.
Recently, new techniques for observing co-cultures in three dimensions have become available\citep{Alessandri}.
We seek to formulate a model of cancer cell behavior in three dimensions by extending previous two dimensional simulations of binary systems of deformable and active colloids\cite{Butcher}.
Together with our experimental collaborators Drs Wu and Ma at Cornell university we aim to characterize the role of difference in physical properties -- 
cell-cell adhesion, cell stiffness and interaction with matrix, between benign and metastatic cells in cancer cell assembly and migration.
Furthermore, we will focus on confined systems to better recreate the physiological and experimental systems we are studying.
From a physics perspective, we will study the interplay of cell mechanics, and statistical mechanical in cell migration in a confined binary system in $3D$.
The main ingredients of the model are discussed below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Co-culture Systems: mechanical stiffness and cell-cell adhesion of cancer cells vs healthy cells}\\
The co-culture environment is a vital component to the migration of cell migration \cite{Miki}.
In several biological processes from the formation of embryos to the formation of tumors, cells of different types lie and move next to each other.
In laboratory experiments, when introduced to a monolayer of healthy cells, cancerous cells have been observed to have higher migration rates than when in a monolayer of other cancerous cells \cite{Lee}.
In addition to the difference in stiffness \cite{Lee}, the adhesion properties of cancer cells have also been found to be drastically different from that of non-cancerous cells\cite{Jeanes}.
Most healthy cells adhere to each other via the protein E-cadherin when they come in contact, and also tend to anchor to the surrounding matrix.
Cancer cells lack this adhesiveness.
The relative adhesiveness and stiffness of the two cultures will be one of the important factors we will include in our analytical model.

\item {\bf Cell migration in three dimensions--different from $2D$ migration.}\\
Many experimental and theoretical studies have addressed various aspects of cell migration in two dimensions, including protrusion, adhesion, and retraction at the level of single cells, and collective motion at the multicellular level.
However, the {\it in vivo} environment for a crawling cell is typically a three-dimensional environment, consisting of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and surrounding cells.
Recent experiments demonstrate that cells crawling along fibers of the ECM mimic the geometry of the fibers to become long and thin, as opposed to cell migration in two dimensions where the cell is spread out in a fan shape \cite{Doyle}.
Other experiments also show increased migration rates of cells in $3D$ matrices as opposed to  $2D$\cite{Cukierman}.

\item{\bf Role of confinement}\\
Current experiments involve observing co-cultures inside of spherical capsules with diameters on the order of several hundred micro-meters and containing tens of cells\cite{Alessandri} (See FIG. \ref{fig:capsule}).
Given that confinement and finite system size can have important consequences for the statistical mechanics and collective properties of the cell-culture, it will be vital to account for them in our model.
The spherical capsules in the experiments we will model have an inner diameter of $50-700$ micro-meters and an outer diameter of $400-7000$ micro-meters.
The cells are present inside the inner capsule and have a dimensions of the order of $\sim 10$ micro-meters.
The region between the inner and outer diameters is occupied by a dense gel layer that the cells can not penetrate.
The outside of this layer is coated such that cells will not adhere to this layer.

   cells.}
   \label{fig:capsule}
\end{figure}

\item{\bf Interaction with the extra cellular matrix}\\
The ECM is a structural network of fibers that interact with the contained 
cells \cite{Alberts}. Healthy cells adhere to the ECM and move along it in
a manner mimicking $1D$ motion. Migration of cells in this manner has been 
observed to be significantly higher than in two dimensional matrices
\cite{Doyle}. Considering the ECM and its properties will thus be very 
important in the development of our three-dimensional model.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Model}

We study the collective dynamics of this system using an active Brownian Dynamics simulation.
Brownian dynamics is ideal for this system
as cells behave like Brownian particles: their dimensions and times scale of motion are much larger than that of the particles of the surrounding  medium in which they are suspended and in equilibrium  their motion is diffusive.
This motion is described by the ``over-damped" Langevin equations, i.e. the inertial or acceleration term is $zero$.
In Brownian Dynamics, we study the coupled equations of motion of the Brownian particles, or in our case, cells.
The contribution of the medium particles is treated as a fluctuating force, often described in terms of a Gaussian noise.
In addition our system is ``active" because cells can generate their own forces by consuming ATP.
The overdamped Langevin equation of a representative cell is as follows\cite{Lemons}: 

\begin{equation}
  \bm{\dot{r}} = \frac{1}{\gamma}\bm{F}_{int}(\bm{r}) + v_p\hat{\bm{v}}_i+\sqrt{2D}\eta^T
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \dot{\theta}_i=\sqrt{2D_r}\eta^R_i
\end{equation}

Where $F_{int}$ is the interaction forces on the cell from adhesion and repulsion.
$\bm{r}_i$ and $\dot{\bm{r}}_i$ is the position and velocity of the i\textit{th} particle, respectively.
The constant $\gamma$ is the damping coefficient of the fluid used. It is related to the
diffusion constant, $D$, by $D=\frac{k_BT}{\gamma}$. $v_p$ is the magnitude of propulsion
and $\bm{\hat{v}}_i$ is the direction of propulsion, $\bm{\hat{v}}=(cos\theta_i, sin\theta_i)$.
$\eta^T$ is the translational noise to approximate collisions with smaller particles.
$\eta^R$ is the rotational noise to simulate change in the direction of travel 
from ATP use. Both noise variables follow the fluctuation dissipation theorem:

\begin{equation}
\left\langle \eta(t)\eta(t')\right\rangle = 0 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \eta(t)\eta(t')\right\rangle = 2k_bT\gamma
\delta(t-t')
\end{equation}

% Dimension stuff %

We define $k_BT$ and $\sigma$ to be our units of energy and length and define 
unit time as $\tau = \frac{\sigma^2}{D}$.

The above active overdamped Langevin equation \cite{RednerBaskaran,FilyMarchetti} has already been used in the study of binary active colloids in $2D$ \cite{Butcher}. 
We have extended the $2D$ co-culture system to confined system in $3D$.


% Interaction forces %
\subsection*{Interaction Forces}

The interaction forces are important for investigating how the elasticity and adhesivity of cells affects their migration and segregation. We have modeled the stiffness of the cells using a simple Hookean spring force while we use a `V' well to model the adhesion (See FIG. \ref{fig:interaction}). The result is particles that will desire to be close together, while resisting overlap. The repulsive and adhesive forces take the forms:

\begin{equation}
  F_{rep}(r) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
      1-\frac{r}{\sigma} &, r < 0\\
      0 &, r \ge \sigma
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \label{eq:frep}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  F_{adh}(r) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
      0 &, r \le \sigma \\
      |r - (\sigma+\epsilon)|/\epsilon-1 &, \sigma < r < \sigma+2\epsilon
    \end{array}
  \right.
  \label{eq:fadh}
\end{equation}

To investigate the affects of mismatches in elasticity and adhesion, we normalize the magnitude of the extremes of the forces to one and then multiply by a prefactor that is dependent on the species of the particle. We denote these as $F^0_{rep}$ and $F^0_{adh}$ for the repulsive and adhesive prefactors, respectively.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{interaction.png}
  \caption[capsuleECM]{The two part interaction potential. For small separations
    within the diameter of the cells, there is a hookean, repulsive force. Separations
    outside, but near the cell, experience an adhesive force.}
   \label{fig:interaction}
\end{figure}

% Physical system (Boundaries, packing fraction) %

\subsection*{System Conditions}
We have imposed `hard' barrier boundaries on the system to immitate the conditions
of microfluidic drops. This means that particles may move along or within a
specified radius, but are restricted from moving outside of it. 
The size of the system is dependent on the packing fraction of the system. 
For our simulations, we choose a packing fraction of $\phi=0.4$, which is where 
active colloidal systems have been studied in the past\cite{RednerBaskaran}.
See FIG. \ref{fig:3dconf} for a sample 3D system.

\end{figure}

% Technical stuff %
\subsection*{Numerical Methods}

The dynamics simulations are computed in Julia, a high-performance, dynamic 
programming language for scientific computing. Spatial cell hashing and neighbor 
checking was used for broad phase collision detection to linearize run times 
as a function of the number of total particles. The simulations use a foreward 
Euler method to integrate with a time step of $10^{-6}\tau$. 
Many identical runs for each  simulation were run repeatedly in parallel and 
averaged together to produce data for a given set of parameters.

We have constructed a basic model to simulate the mechanics of a co-culture system. During the next semester, we plan to work closely with experimental data under physical parameters. We will focus on adding a few more components to our model that may be important to the roles of segregation and migration and what is being observed in the laboratory.
We will add an ECM, an important aspect that is present in the microcapsules, as a disordered potential.
The additional consideration of mitosis is another facet that may be important to the behavior of segregation. The division of cells may be important to the overall action of the system, particularly at the time scales that these effects are measured at. The difference in the rate of division between cancerous and healthy cells will also be an important aspect of mitosis and its contribution to the co-culture system.
